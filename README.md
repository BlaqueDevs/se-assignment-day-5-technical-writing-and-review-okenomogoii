      *Why simplifying helps*: "Start" is a more commonly used and understood term. "Initiate" may be familiar in more formal contexts but could be confusing for people who are not used to technical or formal language.
ii) **"Help" instead of "Assist"**:
   - **Help**: "If you need help, call the support team."
   - **Assist**: "If you need assist, call the support team."
      *Why simplifying helps*: "Help" is more straightforward and familiar to most people, whereas "assist" can sound more formal and technical. The simpler word ensures that users can quickly grasp the message.
iii) **"End" instead of "Terminate"**:
   - **End**: "Click here to end the session."
   - **Terminate**: "Click here to terminate the session."
      *Why simplifying helps*: "End" feels more natural and is commonly used in everyday conversations. "Terminate" might seem too severe or technical and could cause confusion, especially for users not familiar with specific jargon.
iv) **"Buy" instead of "Purchase"**:
   - **Buy**: "Click to buy the product."
   - **Purchase**: "Click to purchase the product."
      *Why simplifying helps*: "Buy" is simpler and more widely recognized in everyday language, while "purchase" might sound more formal or technical, potentially causing hesitation in decision-making.
## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?

i) **Making Abstract Ideas Tangible**
   - **Example**: If you're explaining how a network works, you can describe it like a road system. The data is like cars, routers are like traffic signals, and the server is the final destination.
   - **Why it helps**: Examples create a relatable context, turning an abstract concept (like data transmission) into something people can visualize and understand more easily. People often grasp things better when they can tie them to something familiar.

ii) **Improving Retention**
   - **Visuals**: Diagrams, charts, or infographics help break down information into digestible chunks. For instance, a flowchart can show the steps in a process like how to troubleshoot an issue.
